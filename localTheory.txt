Second Theory---!!

In modern science, the term "theory" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed
type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method,
and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. Such theories are described
in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it,
or empirical contradiction ("falsify") of it. Scientific theories are the most reliable,
rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,[1] in contrast to more common uses
of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms
is better characterized by the word hypothesis).[2
