Theory-----

A theory is a systematic and rational form of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or
the conclusions derived from such thinking. It involves contemplative and logical reasoning,
often supported by processes such as observation, experimentation, and research. Theories
can be scientific, falling within the realm of empirical and testable knowledge, or they
may belong to non-scientific disciplines, such as philosophy, art, or sociology. In some
cases, theories may exist independently of any formal discipline.
